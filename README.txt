Twist — Final Package (Vitrine + Prototype)
Files included:
- index.html : landing page with Vibes Haze and interactive mini-prototype
- style.css : styling (dark + neon)
- app.js : demo logic (local prototype)
- logo_icon.svg : stylized leaf icon (gradient)
- logo_full.svg : icon + text logo (SVG)
- mockup_phone_placeholder.svg : simple phone placeholder SVG
- README.txt : instructions + notes

How to test locally:
1) Unzip the package
2) Open index.html in your browser (double-click) — everything runs locally (demo is client-side only)

How to deploy (Vercel recommended):
- Create a GitHub repo, push the files (index.html, style.css, app.js, + svgs) at repo root.
- In Vercel, create a new project and link the repo. Click Deploy.

Notes & next steps:
- Images in the demo currently load from Unsplash (remote). If you prefer local images, tell me and I'll include optimized assets.
- The signup form is local-only. I can wire it to Google Forms, Mailchimp, Airtable, or a real backend if you want.
- If you like the SVG logo, I can also export PNG versions in multiple sizes (favicon, app icon, 512x512) and add them to the package.
- Content keeps a coded language (Vibes Haze) to avoid explicit references and stay on the safe side legally.
